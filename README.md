# scriptbin
A collection of the scripts I use on my home Linux server.

## Includes:
 - `bak`: a modified cp; feed in any files that you want a backup of, and out pops .bak files!
 - `brightness`: outputs the current screen brightness.
 - `inf`: a friendly little info output, easily grep-able and nicely formatted.
 - `sessionlength`: a still somewhat rough way of finding out how long an individual terminal (tty/ptty/etc) has been running.
 - `sounds`: outputs the current volume, mute, or both.
