Changelog for T99's /scriptbin/ bash scripts.
- v1.0
	- Added 'inf'.
		- Inf (obviously standing for information) is a simple utility to gather information, some static, some not, to display to the user
		  such as current system time, internet IP, SSH connection port, or the shell in which the current user is working.

	- Added 'sessionlength'.
		- Sessionlength (personally alias'd as slen) outputs the current session length from $SECONDS in an easy to read, script friendly
		  format.

	- Added 'bak'.
		- Bak takes filename/directory outputs and creates copies of them, newly suffixed with '.bak'.

	- Many things in these scripts are sure to stop working on other people's machines, so submit bug reports to the repository so that I can try
	  to make the script more portable.
